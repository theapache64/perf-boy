> A tool that analyzes your method trace file and generates the analysis in a spreadsheet

Finding performance regression in your app is tough. This tool helps you identify the most time-consuming tasks in your trace and shows how they were performing previously and how they are performing currently. 

### ✨ Installation

```bash
sudo npm install -g perf-sheet 
```

### 📦 Usage

```bash
perf-sheet before.trace after.trace
```

## 🚀 Demo

```bash                                                              ✘ INT
❯ ls
after.trace  before.trace
